I enjoy writing about databases, operating systems, and compilers. Sometimes I also like to write about computer
security and mathematics.

During my career I've worked on batch schedulers, container runtimes, resource pooling, and autoscaling compute. I have experience with
sharding microservices, adding multitenancy to existing systems, deconstructing monoliths, migrating live databases, and introducing eventual consistency to systems. I'm
also weirdly excited by configuration systems, release management, and developers tools in general. I'm currently working on the Supercomputing team at OpenAI.
